# 🧩 Quantum Terminal – Universal Reference Order

**Official Canonical Symbol Reference Sheet**  
*For decoding sequences in the Quantum Terminal puzzle challenge.*

---

## 📘 Instructions

1. **Memorize or keep this sheet nearby.**  
   It defines the **Universal Reference Order** — the only valid decoding sequence.  
2. During gameplay, when the terminal displays symbols in random order,  
   **input them according to this canonical sequence**, *not the visual layout.*  
3. **Any deviation or misordering triggers an instant mission abort.**
